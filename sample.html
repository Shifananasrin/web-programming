	<p><i><align="center">Strawberries are low-growing herbaceous plants with a fibrous root system and a crown from which arise basal leaves. <br>
	The leaves are compound, typically with three leaflets, sawtooth-edged, and usually hairy. <br>
	The flowers, generally white, rarely reddish, are borne in small clusters on slender stalks arising, like the surface-creeping stems, from the axils of the leaves. <br>
	As a plant ages, the root system becomes woody, and the “mother” crown sends out runners (e.g., stolons) that touch ground and root, thus enlarging the plant vegetatively. <br>
	Botanically, the strawberry fruit is considered an “accessory fruit” and is not a true berry. <br>
	The flesh consists of the greatly enlarged flower receptacle and is embedded with the many true fruits, or achenes, which are popularly called seeds..</i></p>
